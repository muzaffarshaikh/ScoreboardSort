# ScoreboardSort
JavaFX Project implementing a Scoreboard like environment.

Problem Statement :
There were submissions made in a programming contest containing infinite problems. 
Each submission earned the contestant points as none of the submissions is a wrong or a partial submission. 
You are given the details of the submissions - the username of the contestant and the time taken to solve the problem. 
Your task is to print the rank list according to the following rules: The contestant with a higher score gets a higher rank. 
If the scores are tied, then the contestant with the least sum of the time taken to solve the problems gets a higher rank. 
In case of a tie in both scores and sum of the time taken, they are ranked lexicographically according to their usernames.

Note: The details of the submissions are not sorted in any order (neither by time nor by username).
